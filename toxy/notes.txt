TODO for toxy
  * widget
    . push long message handlers if defined, instead of short
    . widgetcontainer: woc and wiw-list
    . better megawidgets
    . editor: handle semicolons (need to revisit resolution rules)
    . editor: break editorhook into separate properties, add them in single mode
    . find a way for "package require" to work out-of-the-box on windows
  * tow: canvas-wide and type-on-canvas-wide broadcasting

DONE for toxy

alpha17
  * widget:
    . first sketch of an editor widget (bpf), introducing a basic set of rules:
      - instance data kept in its own namespace
      - gui sends '_data' (replaces '_value') requests to pd, specifying one
	of the standard submessages: add, delete, set, get
      - pd uses the new special handler for replying: @data
      (for the time being, there is only an idle loop between the two sides)
    . maintaining a scriptlet collection, which mirrors type and instance
      handler properties (including specials: @vis, @new, @free and @data)
    . lookup in the mirror for faster and more robust handling of messages 
    . '@ini' section and 'ini' message removed, after being unified as the
      @vis special handler (use 'set @vis' message form for passing options)
    . all special handlers support short definitions (inside #. comments)
      and long definitions (tagged with #@ comments), however only short
      ones may be overriden by instance definitions
    . long message handlers are stored, but not used yet
    . .wid file header may include requirements (base widget definitions)
    . fixed: patch's directory handling in 'redefine'

alpha16
  * widget:
    . editor for options, handlers and arguments made more or less functional
    . better 'redefine' (although still only external types may be redefined)
  * tow:
    . fixed handling of gop-ed targets and missing windows
    . new messages: 'retarget', 'pwd'
  * tot:
    . scriptlet editor improved a little bit (still unfinished)

alpha15
  * fixes for megawidgets
    . setting sub-item bindings in ::toxy::subwidget
      (to be called explicitly from type initializer)
    . handling widget's state through virtual events
    . getting implicit geometry (needed for Frame widgets)
    . automatically rebinding focus for Canvas widgets

alpha14
  * 'redefine' message to widget
  * version control, using package provide (both in tcl and parsed from pd)
  * "> master" section removed:  master initializer defined directly
    by proc ::toxy::master
  * better kb: chords (shift-click), latch (control-click), dragging

alpha13
  * @new and @free handlers, defined in #@ new and  #@ free sections,
    invoked by widget object creation and destruction
  * optional sections #@ ini (aka #@ vis) appended to initializer (which still
    defines in default section too -- old .wid files do not need updating)
  * .#args parameter of message handlers, replaced (during scriptlet
    evaluation) by all arguments of an invoking message
