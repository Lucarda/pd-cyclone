<H1>Cyclone</H1>

<P>
Cyclone is a library of Pure Data classes, bringing some level of compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments.  Although being itself in the early stage of development, it is meant to eventually become part of a much larger project, aiming at unification and standardization of computer musician's tools.
