TODO for cyclone
  * using maxmode object arguments for abstraction-scoped, selective
    compatibility control
  * comment behaving better in windows (or is it gatom's fault?)

DONE for cyclone

alpha53
  * matrix~: incompatible message 'set'
  * coll:
    . fixed descending order of 'sort' (a leaking sentinel bug)
    . ignoring negative indices in 'min' and 'max'
    . editor fixes (close by wm, dirty flag, title)
  * Table: reading from file, reading from editor, editor fixes
  * seq: editor fixes, editor bound to click (should bind to "open" too...)
  * prob, capture, capture~: viewer fixes

alpha52
  * compatibility mode interface in maxmode object:
    messages 'set', 'get' (reply through the second outlet)
  * better handling of initial directory in open panels
  * relative path handling in 'cd' (library objects, seq, more to come)
  * remote reply to 'pwd' message of library objects (target argument required)
  * instead, left outlet of library objects sends return code from import
    (negative value indicates an error)
  * new class: matrix~
  * linedrive: more compatible in maxmode, bipolar otherwise
  * seq:
    . paused state fixes (state preserved in 'goto', proper delay in 'start')
    . 'goto' fix (works in idlemode)
    . more incompatible messages: 'scoretime', 'cd', 'pwd'

alpha51
  * dummies loaded by maxmode, not cyclone
  * setting directory in creation argument replaced with 'cd' message
    to library objects (cyclone, maxmode, hammer and sickle)
  * 'pwd' message to library objects sends directory symbol to an outlet
  * creating cyclone and maxmode library objects possible without
    loading component libraries
  * prepend and Append:
    . bang handling, controlled by maxmode
    . restored max-like 'set' handling as default for objects with arguments
  * fix for parsing creation arguments in svf~
  * incompatible additions to seq: 'pause', 'continue', 'goto'

alpha50
  * max-compatibility mode switch for cyclone
    . turned on by loading cyclone libs through "-lib maxmode"
    . affects max-compatibility of prepend and Append, controls
      compatibility warnings
