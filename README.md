Cyclone is a library of clones of Max/MSP objects for Pure Data

<strong>Original Project Description (by Krzysztof Czaja):</strong>

Cyclone is a library of PureData classes, bringing some level of compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments. Although being itself in the early stage of development, it is meant to eventually become part of a much larger project, aiming at unification and standardization of computer musician's tools. 

In its current form, cyclone is mainly for people using both Max and Pd, and thus wanting to develop cross-platform patches. In this respect, cyclone has much in common with Thomas Grill's flext, and flext-based externals. See Thomas' page. While flext enables developing new cross-platform classes, cyclone makes existing classes cross-platform. 

Cyclone also comes handy, somewhat, in the task of importing Max/MSP 4.x patches into Pd. Do not expect miracles, though, it is usually not an easy task.

<strong>History Of Cyclone up tp the present day:</strong>

Original author of cyclone is Krzysztof Czaja, who maintained it from 2002-2005. After that, cyclone was also a part of Pd Extended and was maintained by Hans-Christoph Steiner until Pd Extended was left unmaintained (up to 2013). Fred Jan Kraan maintained cyclone from dec-2014 to feb-2016. Since feb-2016, a new maintenance is now being proposed by Porres and Schiavoni & collaborators on this repository.

<strong>About this repository, Goals & Further Development:</strong>

Location of this repository is https://github.com/porres/pd-cyclone. Amongst other things, the original cyclone library is found at the <https://git.puredata.info/cgit/svn2git/libraries/miXed.git/> repository, it includes the cyclone library version 0.1-Alpha56, present in the last release of Pd Extended [version 0.43.4] released in january  2013. This release is now available in the deken plug in as "cyclone-v0-0extended". A fork from this original repository is found at <https://github.com/electrickery/pd-miXedSon>, and includes a newer version "0.2beta1" of cyclone from december 2015 - also available for download via the deken plug in. 

The work from <https://github.com/electrickery/pd-miXedSon> is now forked this repository. Another cyclone version could emerge anytime from this repository with bug fixes, new objects and new functionalities aiming to an up to date clone of Max/MSP objects. 

This repository is faithful to the original goal of cyclone in creating an external library with a collection of Max/MSP objects for Pure Data. Original version of cyclone was developed in time of Max/MSP 4.6, so most of the existing work that was made in cyclone is still outdated to that version. Cyclone "0.2beta1" had still some objects with functionalities from Max/MSP 4.6 and some updated to Max/MSP 5.

If in agreement to the Pd community of users and developers, this repository can release updates (probably "0.3beta1" and on) of the cyclone project, where, besides current bug fixes, new/further developments can include:

<strong>- A)</strong> New functionalities introduced in newer versions of Max/MSP into the already existing objects in cyclone.

<strong>- B)</strong> New objects according to the most current version of Max/MSP version (version 7 nowadays). 

This repository/project is open to collaboration to anyone who wishes to work according to the key and central goal of Max/MSP compatibility. Ideally, all of the possible Max/MSP objects could be cloned or updated, but this is a fair amount of work so collaborators are free to decide and work on what they consider more relevant and important. Any object that has full or "most possible" compatibility to current Max/MSP can be included. Some collaborators are already helping coding new objects, a list of known bugs and things "to do" will be made available with the first release to come from this repository.
