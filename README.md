<strong>Previous and Current state</strong>

this is fork Fred Jan Kraan's github at https://github.com/electrickery/pd-cyclone), which on its own was a a 'fork' of the https://git.puredata.info/cgit/svn2git/libraries/miXed.git/ migrated repository that contained only the cyclone functionality, removing other libraries.

The version of cyclone available in https://git.puredata.info/cgit/svn2git/libraries/miXed.git/ is 0.1-Alpha56, present in Pd Extended 0.43. A new "unreleased" version 0.1-Alpha57 that was maintained by Fred is found in <http://puredata.info/downloads/cyclone>. Fred was also working a new version 0.2beta1, which is now forked to this repositoty. The original location of this repository is https://github.com/porres/pd-cyclone.

Version 0.2beta1 is available for download via the deken plug in, another version will emerge from this repository with new objects, new functionalities, and bug fixes very soon.

<strong>Goals and Further Development</strong>

This repository is faithful to the original goal of cyclone in creating an external library with a collection of Max/MSP objects for Pure Data. The early and original version of cyclone was in time of Max/MSP 4.6. New further development can include new functionalities introduced in newer versions of Max/MSP into the already existing objects in cyclone, and can also include new objects according to the most current version of Max/MSP version (version 7 nowadays). 

Project is open to collaboration. Ideally all possible objects could be cloned and kept updated, but this is a fair amount of work so collaborators are free to decide and work on what they consider more relevant and important.

<strong>Original Project Description</strong> (from http://puredata.info/downloads/cyclone)

Cyclone is a library of PureData classes, bringing some level of compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments. Although being itself in the early stage of development, it is meant to eventually become part of a much larger project, aiming at unification and standardization of computer musician's tools. 

In its current form, cyclone is mainly for people using both Max and Pd, and thus wanting to develop cross-platform patches. In this respect, cyclone has much in common with Thomas Grill's flext, and flext-based externals. See Thomas' page. While flext enables developing new cross-platform classes, cyclone makes existing classes cross-platform. 

Cyclone also comes handy, somewhat, in the task of importing Max/MSP 4.x patches into Pd. Do not expect miracles, though, it is usually not an easy task.
