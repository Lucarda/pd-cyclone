cyclone
-------

Cyclone is a library of PureData classes, bringing some level of compatibility
between Max/MSP and Pd environments, mainly for people using both Max and Pd, and
thus wanting to develop cross-platform patches. Cyclone comes with individual external binaries and a cyclone sub-library:

 * The individual external binaries can be loaded only by inserting cyclone folder in the search path of Pd. 

 * The cyclone sub-library loads a small set of operators (!-, !/, ==~, !=~, <~, <=~, >~, >=~, !-~, !/~, %~, +=~) and can be loaded in Pdâ€™s startup once the search path contains the cyclone folder.
