#X text 63 191 - Cyclone's development starts in 2002 (at the time
of Max 4.0) and never reached full compliance to the latest Max 4 release
(4.6.3 from 2007). Cyclone 0.3 updates the library by including missing
functionalities from Max 4 and further updates (from Max 5 to Max 7).
, f 73;
#X text 63 253 - New objects were also included and several bug fixes
were made \; check details in the changelog at: https://github.com/porres/pd-cyclone/wiki/cyclone-0.3-changlelog
, f 73;
#X text 68 351 Most of cyclone objects are single binaries \, so all
you need is to have the cyclone folder at an user added path. But there's
also a "cyclone sub-library" that includes a subset of 12 non-alphanumeric
objects. To install it you need to include "cyclone" in Pd's Startup.
