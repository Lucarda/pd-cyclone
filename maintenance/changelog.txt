0.1.alpha56 - available in the last pd extended version (0.43)
  * fixed inversed phase output of car-pool~

0.1.alpha55 -  available up to Pd-Extended 0.42-5
  * new class: overdrive~
  * seq:
    . new incompatible message 'tempo': 1-based coef, does not start playback
    . fix for double-to-float-pair calc in 'scoretime' and 'goto'
  * abs~: performance fix
  * slide~, rampsmooth~: bashing denormals

0.1.alpha54 - Last Pre Extended version
  * comment: fixing namespace bug, reducing traffic
  * testmess: optionally filling message with symbols (numbers in hex form
    or names of all registered classes)

0.1.alpha53
  * matrix~: incompatible message 'set'
  * coll:
    . fixed descending order of 'sort' (a leaking sentinel bug)
    . ignoring negative indices in 'min' and 'max'
    . editor fixes (close by wm, dirty flag, title)

0.1.alpha52
  * compatibility mode interface in maxmode object:
    messages 'set', 'get' (reply through the second outlet)
  * better handling of initial directory in open panels
  * relative path handling in 'cd' (library objects, seq, more to come)
  * remote reply to 'pwd' message of library objects (target argument required)
  * instead, left outlet of library objects sends return code from import
    (negative value indicates an error)
  * new class: matrix~
  * linedrive: more compatible in maxmode, bipolar otherwise
  * seq:
    . paused state fixes (state preserved in 'goto', proper delay in 'start')
    . 'goto' fix (works in idlemode)
    . more incompatible messages: 'scoretime', 'cd', 'pwd'

0.1.alpha51
  * dummies loaded by maxmode, not cyclone
  * setting directory in creation argument replaced with 'cd' message
    to library objects (cyclone, maxmode, hammer and sickle)
  * 'pwd' message to library objects sends directory symbol to an outlet
  * creating cyclone and maxmode library objects possible without
    loading component libraries
  * prepend and Append:
    . bang handling, controlled by maxmode
    . restored max-like 'set' handling as default for objects with arguments
  * fix for parsing creation arguments in svf~
  * incompatible additions to seq: 'pause', 'continue', 'goto'

0.1.alpha50
